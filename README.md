# odin-recipes
The initial project will be to build a website page containing recipes from different nationalities.

The purpose is to learn how to generate absolute and relative links between pages. And also practice some HTML fundamentals and interact with git. Later, the CSS style will be inserted to improve the visualization of the site.
