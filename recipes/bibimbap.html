                <li>2 carrots, cut into matchsticks </li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>1 pound thinly-sliced beef top round steak</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>4 cups cooked white rice</li>
                <li>4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, divided</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste), divided (Optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside.</li>
                <li>Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; 
                    cook until bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach aside in a 
                    bowl and stir in soy sauce.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir carrots until 
                    softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in cucumber mixture; 
                    sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Set carrot mixture aside in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes per side; 
                    set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. 
                    Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces 
                    of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 
                    1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang 
                    paste if desired.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Tips</h3>
            <p>You can use Sriracha sauce instead of gochujang, or substitute with soy sauce for those 
                who cannot handle the spiciness.</p>
