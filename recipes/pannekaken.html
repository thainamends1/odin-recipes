        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine milk and eggs in a blender; add flour, sugar, and salt and blend until smooth.</li>
                <li>Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Scoop about 
                    1/4 cup batter into the skillet, and tilt the pan until the batter coats the bottom. 
                    Cook until the top looks dry, about 30 seconds. Carefully slide a spatula under the 
                    pancake and flip. Cook just until browned on the other side, about 3 seconds. 
                    Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
