        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 large eggplant</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoons tahini sauce</li>
                <li>½ medium lemon, juiced</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 pinch dried parsley flakes, for garnish</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place one rack in the lower third of the oven and another one in the upper third. 
                    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Cut a shallow slit along the side of the eggplant and place into a baking dish.</li>
                <li>Roast on the lower rack of the preheated oven until eggplant is completely shrunken 
                    and soft, about 40 minutes. Move to the upper rack and continue baking until skin is 
                    charred, about 5 more minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to 
                    handle, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Peel and discard eggplant skin. Place eggplant flesh into a bowl; stir in garlic, 
                    tahini, lemon juice, pepper flakes, and salt until well combined. Drizzle olive 
                    oil over top and garnish with parsley.</li>
            </ol>
