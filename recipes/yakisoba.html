        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 (8 ounce) packages buckwheat soba noodles</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 pound pork tenderloin, cut against the grain in thin strips</li>
                <li>2 cups carrots, cut into julienne strips</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, cut into julienne strips</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>½ head napa cabbage, shredded</li>
                <li>⅔ cup yakisoba sauce</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons pickled red ginger (beni shoga), or to taste</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons kizami nori (dried flaked aonori seaweed), or to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook soba in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
                    until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse 
                    with cold water. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a wok over medium heat. Add pork and stir-fry with a pinch of salt and pepper, 
                    about 5 minutes. Transfer meat to a plate, reserving oil in wok. Add carrots, onion, ginger, 
                    and garlic to the wok and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add cabbage to the wok and stir-fry briefly, about 1 minute. Add drained soba noodles. 
                    Pour in 1/2 the yakisoba sauce and stir-fry until noodles and vegetables are covered with 
                    sauce, about 3 minutes. Return pork to the wok. Add additional sauce as desired. 
                    Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Garnish yakisoba with kizami nori and a small pile of beni shoga just before serving.</li>
            </ol>
