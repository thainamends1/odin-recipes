            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup water</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>

                <li>1 small garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet 
                    with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
                <li>Combine ground pork, bread crumbs, shallot, lemongrass paste, mint, fish sauce, 
                    brown sugar, garlic, ginger root, and salt in a large bowl. Using a 1-tablespoon 
                    cookie scoop, shape mixture into meatballs, and place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are no longer pink in the center and 
                    cooked through, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare the dipping sauce by mixing water, fish sauce, lime juice, 
                    sugar, Thai chile, and garlic in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
                <li>Place meatballs under the hot broiler just until the tops start to turn brown 
                    to get a little color and crispness, about 2 minutes. Serve with the dipping sauce.</li>
            </ol>
